Bootstrap Blog for 100 Days of Code!

This is a Blog website built with HTML + CSS (Bootstrap) and Python (Flask and Jinja).

Every page is generated through a Flask code. Blog posts come from an API using requests (a separate python file was created for this API interaction alone).

Blog posts have their link programatically built, so that there is scabilty in the application. The same code is able to render as much posts as needed.
It is recommended, however, to limit posts per page if needed, or there will be infinite scrolling in he future.
